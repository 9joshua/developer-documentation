# Running tests/builds on GitHub Action

[Github Action](https://github.com/features/actions) is a continuous integration tool that will run tests/builds for a GitHub repository every time commits are pushed.

## Matomo on GitHub Action 

Matomo uses GitHub Action to automatically run its build on every commit (for every branch and pull request).

Each developer is responsible to keep the build green.

## Github Action Scripts

All the Github Action build file are locate in `.github/workflows/*.yml`

Each scripts are trigger by its own conditions, for more details see [Github Action Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

## Create a new CI script

To create a new CI script please read [Quickstart for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart) 

We recommend fork the Matomo project first and run on your own pipeline first. Also, please check the list before get starts.


- Marketplace: To use a marketplace action/container, please always choose the official service or container.
- Security Check: Make sure you read [script injection attacks](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/security-hardening-for-github-actions#example-of-a-script-injection-attack) and [Security hardening](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions) 
- Permission: we recommend use read permissions for the CI unless you want to update the code after CI runs, for more details [Assigning permissions to jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs)
