# Running tests/builds on GitHub Action

[Github Action](https://github.com/features/actions) makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. Make code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging work the way you want.

## Matomo on GitHub Action 

Matomo uses GitHub Action to automatically run its build on every commit (for every branch and pull request).

Each developer is responsible to keep the build green.

## Github Action Scripts

All the Github Action build file are locate in `.github/workflows/*.yml`

Each script is trigger by its own conditions, for more details see [Github Action Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

## Create a new CI script

To create a new CI script please read [Quickstart for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart) 

We recommend forking the Matomo project first and running actions on your own pipeline first. Also, please check the following list before getting started:


- Marketplace: To use a marketplace action/container, please always choose the official service or container.
- Security Check: Make sure you read [script injection attacks](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/security-hardening-for-github-actions#example-of-a-script-injection-attack) and [Security hardening](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions) 
- Permission: we recommend using read permissions for the CI unless you want to update the code after CI runs, for more details [Assigning permissions to jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs)
