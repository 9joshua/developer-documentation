# Running tests/builds on GitHub Action

[Github Action](https://github.com/features/actions) makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. Make code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging work the way you want.

## Matomo on GitHub Action 

Matomo uses GitHub Action to automatically run its build by various triggers.
- [Build Tracker JS] Trigger by the comment `build js` into the pull request.
- [Build VUE] Auto trigger, then comment back to the PR
- [Composer Update] Auto trigger by cron
- [PHPCS check] Auto trigger, if not valid will return error details.
- [Inactive PR] after 14 days, inactive PR will mark as state 


Each developer is responsible to keep the commits/pull requests build green.

## Github Action Scripts

All the Github Action build file are locate in `.github/workflows/*.yml`

Each script is trigger by its own conditions, for more details see [Github Action Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

## Create a new CI script

To create a new CI script please read [Quickstart for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart) 

We recommend forking the Matomo project first and running actions on your own pipeline first. Also, please check the following list before getting started:


- Marketplace: To use a marketplace action/container, please always choose the official service or container.
- Security Check: Make sure you read [script injection attacks](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/security-hardening-for-github-actions#example-of-a-script-injection-attack) and [Security hardening](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions) 
- Permission: we recommend using read permissions for the CI unless you want to update the code after CI runs, for more details [Assigning permissions to jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs)
