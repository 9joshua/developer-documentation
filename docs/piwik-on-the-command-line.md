What's missing? (stuff in my list that was not in when I wrote the 1st draft)

## About this guide

**Read this guide if**

* you'd like to know **how to use a specific command with Piwik's command line tool**
* you'd like to know **how your plugin can create a new command for the command line tool**
* you'd like to know more about **how the command line tool works**

**Guide assumptions**

This guide assumes that you:

* can code in PHP,
* and have installed Piwik (if not read our [Getting Started](/guides/getting-started-part-1) guide)

## The **console** tool

Piwik comes with a special command line tool that can be used to make development easier. The tool is located in Piwik's root directory and is called **console**. You can run it with the command:

    ./console help

or

    php ./console help

**Libraries Used**

The console app uses the [Symfony Console component](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/introduction.html). It would have been installed when you ran [composer.phar](http://getcomposer.org/) while installing Piwik.

### Commands

The command line tool currently supports commands that generate empty plugins and plugin files, run git commands, watch Piwik's log output, run tests and deal with Piwik translations.

You can view the entire list of commands by running the following command:

    ./console list

To get more information about a single command (such as what arguments it takes), run the following command:

    ./console help <<command>>

where `<<command>>` should be replaced with the command you are interested in.

## Adding new commands

Plugins can extend the command line tool by creating their own commands. To do so you can use the CLI itself: 

    ./console generate:command --pluginname=MyPlugin
    
This will create a folder named `Commands` within your plugin, if necessary, along with a PHP file which represents the actual command. You can add an unlimited number of commands using the CLI.

See the docs for [SymfonyCommand](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/index.html) to learn more about how your command should be coded.
