AddColumnsProcessedMetricsGoal
==============================

Adds goal related metrics to a DataTable using metrics that already exist.

Metrics added are:

- **revenue_per_visit**: total goal and ecommerce revenue / nb_visits
- **goal_%idGoal%_conversion_rate**: the conversion rate. There will be one of
                                     these columns for each goal that exists
                                     for the site.
- **goal_%idGoal%_nb_conversions**: the number of conversions. There will be one of
                                    these columns for each goal that exists
                                    for the site.
- **goal_%idGoal%_revenue_per_visit**: goal revenue / nb_visits. There will be one of
                                       these columns for each goal that exists
                                       for the site.
- **goal_%idGoal%_revenue**: goal revenue. There will be one of
                             these columns for each goal that exists
                             for the site.
- **goal_%idGoal%_avg_order_revenue**: goal revenue / number of orders or abandoned
                                       carts. Only for ecommerce order and abandoned cart
                                       reports.
- **goal_%idGoal%_items**: number of items. Only for ecommerce order and abandoned cart
                           reports.

Adding the **filter_update_columns_when_show_all_goals** query parameter to
an API request will trigger the execution of this Filter.

_Note: This filter must be called before [ReplaceColumnNames](/api-reference/Piwik/DataTable/Filter/ReplaceColumnNames) is called._

    $dataTable->filter('AddColumnsProcessedMetricsGoal',
        array($enable = true, $idGoal = Piwik::LABEL_ID_GOAL_IS_ECOMMERCE_ORDER));
