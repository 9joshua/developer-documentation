Welcome to the *Develop* section of the Piwik Developer Zone. If you are interested in customizing Piwik, you are at the right place!

This section contains guides that will help you to create **Plugins** and **Themes** to customize Piwik or add new features to Piwik.

If you want to get more insight into how Piwik works behind the API's check out our [Piwik In Depth](/piwik-in-depth) section.

Use the sidebar to navigate through the guides. Here is a list of guides to get you started:

- [Getting Started: Setting up](/guides/getting-started-part-1)
