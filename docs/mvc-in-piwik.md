# MVC (Model-View-Controller)

<!-- Meta (to be deleted)
Purpose:
 - describe request -> FrontController -> Controller -> API + twig views -> output process
 - describe Twig templates + how to use

Audience: plugin developers or core developers that want to know more about controllers, API, Twig Views

Expected Result: developers that understand how requests are handled by Piwik, how to implement controller methods, API methods, twig views.

Notes: 

What's missing? (stuff in my list that was not in when I wrote the 1st draft)
  - user roles (not sure where to put this... would be a short guide if on its own)
  - posting notifications (should go in controller section under 'alternative ways to communicate w/ the user'?)
