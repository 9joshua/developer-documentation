# Getting Started

You're a Piwik user and you need Piwik to do something it doesn't do. Or maybe you're a user of another web app and you want to integrate it with this amazing analytics software you've heard so much about (Piwik, naturally). Well, you've come to the right place!

This guide will show you:

- **how to get your development environment setup,**
- **how to create a new Piwik Plugin,**
- **and where to go next to continue building your extension.**

## Guide assumptions

This guide assumes that you can code in PHP and can setup your own local webserver. If you do not have these skills, you will not be able to understand this guide.

There are many resources on the internet to learn PHP. We recommend reading [these tutorials](http://devzone.zend.com/6/). To learn how to setup a webserver read the documentation for your preferred webserver software (for example [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) or [Nginx](http://nginx.org/)).
